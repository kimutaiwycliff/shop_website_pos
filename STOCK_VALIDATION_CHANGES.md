# Product Stock Validation Implementation

This document summarizes the changes made to implement product stock validation in the POS system to prevent exceeding existing stock and automatically remove products when sold out.

## Changes Made

### 1. POS Component Updates (`src/blocks/POS/Component.tsx`)

#### Stock Validation Functions
- Added `updateProductStock` function to update product stock in the database
- Added `refreshProducts` function to refresh product data after sales

#### Enhanced Validation Logic
- Modified `addToCart` function to check stock availability before adding products
- Enhanced `updateQuantity` function to validate quantity changes against available stock
- Added visual indicators for stock levels in product grid and cart items
- Improved error handling and user feedback

#### Sale Processing
- Updated `processSale` function to:
  - Automatically update stock levels for all items in the cart
  - Mark products as "out of stock" when inventory reaches zero
  - Refresh product data to reflect updated stock levels
  - Provide better error handling and user notifications

#### UI Improvements
- Added visual indicators for stock levels (color-coded badges)
- Disabled product cards for out-of-stock items
- Added stock information display in cart items
- Improved button states (disabled when max stock reached)

### 2. Product Collection Updates (`src/collections/Products/index.ts`)

#### New Status Field
- Added `status` field with options: 'published', 'draft', 'out-of-stock'
- Added field to admin UI with sidebar positioning

#### Enhanced Hooks
- Added `beforeValidate` hook to ensure stock values are never negative
- Added logic to automatically update product status based on stock levels:
  - Set to 'out-of-stock' when inventory reaches zero
  - Set to 'published' when inventory is added to out-of-stock items
- Enhanced `beforeChange` hook to log stock changes for audit purposes
- Updated `afterChange` hook to handle barcode generation and status updates

### 3. Stock Validation Utility (`src/blocks/POS/stockValidation.ts`)

Created a dedicated utility module with validation functions:
- `validateStockAvailability`: Validates if a product can be added to the cart
- `validateQuantityUpdate`: Validates quantity updates for existing cart items

### 4. Product Collection Filtering

Updated product fetching logic to:
- Only fetch products with 'published' status
- Exclude 'draft' and 'out-of-stock' products from the POS interface

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Prevent Over-Selling**: 
   - Users cannot add more items than available in stock
   - Real-time validation when adding items to cart
   - Validation when updating quantities

2. **Automatic Status Updates**:
   - Products automatically marked as "out of stock" when inventory reaches zero
   - Products automatically marked as "published" when inventory is restocked

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Color-coded stock indicators (green = in stock, yellow = low stock, red = out of stock)
   - Disabled product cards for out-of-stock items
   - Clear error messages when stock limits are exceeded

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - Stock values are never negative
   - Stock changes are logged for audit purposes
   - Database updates are handled through proper API calls

## Testing

Created unit tests for stock validation logic:
- Validation of stock availability when adding products
- Validation of quantity updates
- Edge cases (out of stock, maximum quantities)

## How It Works

1. **Adding Products to Cart**:
   - System checks available stock before adding items
   - Prevents adding items that would exceed stock limits
   - Shows clear error messages when stock is insufficient

2. **Updating Quantities**:
   - Real-time validation when increasing/decreasing quantities
   - Buttons disabled when max/min quantities reached
   - Visual indicators show available stock

3. **Processing Sales**:
   - Stock levels automatically reduced for all items in cart
   - Products marked as "out of stock" when inventory reaches zero
   - Product data refreshed to reflect current stock levels

4. **Product Status Management**:
   - Automatic status updates based on stock levels
   - Products filtered by status in POS interface
   - Only "published" products displayed in POS

## Benefits

- Prevents over-selling and negative inventory
- Improves user experience with clear feedback
- Maintains data integrity through validation
- Automates inventory status management
- Provides audit trail for stock changes
